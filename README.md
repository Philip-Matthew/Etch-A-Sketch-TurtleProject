## Description:
This Python program utilizes the Turtle module to create a simple drawing interface where users can control the movement of a turtle on the screen using keyboard inputs. The turtle can move forwards, backwards, rotate clockwise, rotate counterclockwise, and clear the screen.

## Usage:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run the Python script `turtle_drawing.py`.
3. Use the following keyboard inputs to control the turtle:
   - Press 'd' to move the turtle forwards.
   - Press 'a' to move the turtle backwards.
   - Press 'w' to rotate the turtle upwards.
   - Press 's' to rotate the turtle downwards.
   - Press 'c' to clear the screen and reset the turtle's position.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Turtle module

## Files:
- `turtle_drawing.py`: Contains the Python script for the turtle drawing program.

## Additional Notes:
- The turtle's movement can be adjusted by modifying the `move_forwards()`, `move_backwards()`, `move_upwards()`, and `move_downwards()` functions in the Python script.
- Feel free to customize the program according to your preferences or project requirements.
